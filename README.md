## Description

This project is a Social Network API that uses MongoDB and Mongoose ODM to work with data, Javascript, Express and Node to manage the backend routes. This only consists of the backend and should be later matched with front-end development. With the current routes, the Database can store both Users & Thoughts (that can be considered as posts from any social media application), and the user can perform al CRUD operations. Look into an application like Insomnia or Postman to test these routes!
